# Image Sharer
A simple image sharer between multiple clients.

## TODO :
- Encrypt encoded images.
- Compression of images ask for user as losseless/ lossy and send accordingly.
- Create a redis pub sub channel to share between multiple clients.
- Make each service as a producer and consumer.
- Give an option to share only to a particular consumer.

### note : IN progress.
